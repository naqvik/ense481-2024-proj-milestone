* Flybrix drones
Project specific requirements to be done by the milestone date

1. Demonstrate communication between the drone and an external unit
   (could be the hand controller? or something else)

2. Identify the channels and their limitations.  Can they be used to
   send human-readable information?  (a long shot, I know)

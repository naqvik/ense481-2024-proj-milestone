* Analyzing and controlling power consumption
Project specific requirements to be done by the milestone date

1. Have an estimate of expected power consumption for your system, in
   all its modes of operation.

2. Have the test equipment up and running, and demo this.

3. You need to be running some sort of application, in addition to
   your test code.  If you have a clear idea of the application, fine,
   but if not may I suggest using the IMU breakout board to display
   your current roll and pitch on the screen.  You could also
   incorporate the magnetometer to show yaw.  You can use available
   libraries for quick startup.
   - this also enables experimenting with turning an external device
     on/off

* ENSE481 Milestone: [2024-03-20 Wed]
** Generic Requirements
These are applicable to all the projects

1. The firmware shall embed a version number and build date.  This
   information shall be retrievable by the user through, for example,
   a CLI invocation.  If that's not practicable (I'm thinking of the
   flybrix projects) then find a way that the firmware can be forced
   to emit this information.
2. You shall identify the modules (i.e the main subsystems) in your
   project.  The module interfaces shall be documented using [[https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html][doxygen]]
   or equivalent.

3. The project *main* file shall contain a header comment that
   incorporates the suggestions from Nigel Jones's [[https://embeddedgurus.com/stack-overflow/2013/02/whats-in-your-main-header/][blog entry]]: /What's
   in your main() header?/
